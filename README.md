# Welcome to my portfolio


## Most of this is boilerplate, but I will call out the following three dependencies:

- `animejs` -> A javascript animation library, used for the grid animation inside of DotGrid.tsx
- `framer-motion` -> A react based animation library, used in a hand full of places (anywhere you see `<motion.el />` style components)
- `sass` -> All styling uses plain CSS and sass modules for this project
